<!-- OSF guidelines:
"Full description of proposed sample characteristics, including criteria for data inclusion and exclusion (e.g. outlier extraction). Procedures for objectively defining exclusion criteria due to technical errors or for any other reasons must be specified, including details of how and under what conditions data would be replaced." -->

We prepared our manuscript with `RMarkdown` in `r my_citations$r` which had several benefits. We reduced research degrees of freedom [@WICHERTS2016] by formalizing data preprocessing and exclusion (section \@ref(methods-exclusion)), the analyses (section \@ref(methods-analyses)), and to some extent the results (section \@ref(results-pilot)). We conducted pilot analyses (section \@ref(methods-data)) which we used to optimize all code, but we expect that minor code changes may be necessary due to data irregularities (e.g., variable names). Because the analysis pipeline was already scripted for the pilot analyses, `git` version control will allow anyone to track and verify (the need for) those changes. Finally, preparing the analyses in `R` and making the code publicly available fosters Open Science: researchers can easily replicate the analyses on new data sets, use different (model) parameters, and expand with additional analyses or visualizations. All scripts are available via the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/dw23y/?view_only=25b62f307a1349e7883549b473091483) which is connected to a Github repository (*removed for review purposes*).

In section \@ref(methods-data) we will first discuss the origin and nature of the data we base our analyses on. We will also describe the differences between the pilot data and the proposed full data set. In section \@ref(methods-exclusion) we will describe the exclusion criteria and how each of them affects the data with which we are working. We then describe in section \@ref(methods-analyses) the intended plan of analyses: how we computed the (reliability) of the validation criteria and intend to compare stimulus validity across IATs and stimulus types (nouns, names, images). The full research plan was approved by the Ethics Review Board at the *name removed for review purposes* [^ethics].

[^ethics]: The Ethics Review Board of *name removed for review purposes* approved the research plan on 19th of March 2021 (ref: *removed for review purposes*).
