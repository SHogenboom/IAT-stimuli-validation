  This publication is part of the project "The biased reality of online media - Using stereotypes to make media manipulation visible" (with project number 406.DI.19.059) of the research programme Open Competition Digitalisation-SSH which is financed by the Dutch Research Council (NWO). We further want to acknowledge that this research would not be possible without the research efforts and open data policies of Project Implicit ([https://www.projectimplicit.net/](https://www.projectimplicit.net/)).
abstract: | 
    The Implicit Association Test [IAT, @GREENWALD1998] is a popular instrument for measuring attitudes and (stereotypical) biases. The outcome measure $D_{IAT}$ is directly affected by a stimuli (categories and exemplars) and participant interaction. This interaction may cause undesirable stimulus effects – stimulus unfamiliarity and/or cross-category associations – which directly affect the direction and size of $D_{IAT}$. Changes to the stimuli or the target population therefore warrant (re-)validation of the included stimuli to ensure that undesirable stimulus effects were not accidently introduced. @GREENWALD2021 propose a concrete method for validating stimuli: appropriate stimuli should be familiar and easy to classify – translating to rapid (response times < 800 ms) and accurate (error < 10%) participant responses. We will conduct three analyses to explore the theoretical and practical utility of these proposed validation criteria. We first apply the proposed validation criteria to the data of 15 IATs that were available via Project Implicit. We then explore the context dependency of validity by comparing the validity of stimuli that are used across multiple IATs. Finally, we study the sensitivity of stimulus validity for different stimulus types.
