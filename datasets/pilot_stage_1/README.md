# Stage 1

- The Compressed data (.sav) was downloaded from Project Implicit's Open Science Framework (OSF; https://osf.io/abxq7/).
- The Raw data was attained via personal correspondence with Project Implicit's data manager (Jordan Axt).

All data is available for download via the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/dw23y/)

# Stage 2

- We have changed our data retrieval approach because all data (raw & compressed) is now publicly available via the OSF.
- We have kept these files for transparency purposes, but they are no longer used in the actual analyses.
